_X
==
After trying to find the "jQuery" for After Effects scripting, I decided to start building out a library that offers robust features to help you script in After Effects. 

The goal of _X is to become a library for After Effects scripting that will help you write less & do more. Think of _X as the jQuery for After Effects.

#_X After Effects .jsx Library
_X os still currently still under development. While it is functional, it is not ready to be used in a live production of your next After Effects project! If you are interested in helping with developing this library, please feel free to checkout and contribute to this repo.
